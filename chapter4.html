            <p>As the days continued to unfold, I mustered the courage to send that friend request to Althea, half-expecting the notification to pop up with a cold rejection. However, to my surprise and elation, she accepted my request, and my heart did somersaults of joy. I seized the opportunity to strike up a conversation, initially focusing on academics and homework, topics that felt safe and neutral. The happiness I felt was palpable, and with every message exchanged, my obsession with her only deepened.</p>

            <p>But there was a twist in this unfolding story. A friend of mine, Herrick, happened to know Althea's cousin, Cometa. This connection added an unexpected layer of intrigue to the situation. Herrick couldn't resist informing Cometa about our budding online friendship, and I couldn't help but wonder if Cometa would relay this information to Althea. Did Althea know about my secret crush? The mere thought sent a mixture of excitement and anxiety coursing through my veins.</p>

            <p>As I navigated the complexities of this newfound connection with Althea, I couldn't help but wonder if my indirect approach was working in my favor. The butterflies in my stomach persisted, and I found myself unable to think of much else but her. With each passing day, the line between admiration and infatuation blurred further, leaving me eagerly anticipating what the future might hold.</p>

            <p>As this chapter comes to a close, I find myself grateful for the journey that has brought me to this point. The story of love, longing, and self-discovery has been a profound one, and I hope you've enjoyed reading it as much as I've enjoyed sharing it with you.</p>
            <p>While this may be "The End for Now," the story of James and Althea is far from over. Life is full of twists and turns, and who knows what the future holds for us. But one thing is certain: love, in all its forms, will continue to be a driving force in our lives.</p>
            <p>Thank you for joining me on this adventure. Until we meet again...</p>

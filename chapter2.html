            <p>On the second day of school, the atmosphere buzzed with excitement as officer elections took place. Among the candidates, a remarkable girl named Althea emerged as the class president. I had heard of Althea before, as she had been an active member of the Supreme Student Government (SSG), and her reputation for leadership preceded her. As she stood before the class, confidently presenting her ideas and plans, I couldn't help but be captivated by her charisma and intelligence. Althea was not only a capable leader but also undeniably beautiful, both inside and out. I found myself drawn to her, admiring her from afar and, dare I say, simping for her. It left me wondering, could this be the onset of something more profound? The possibility of love was a tantalizing thought, one that had me questioning my own feelings and pondering the mysteries of the heart.</p>

            <p>In the days that followed, my fascination with Althea continued to grow. I couldn't help but steal glances in her direction during class, marveling at her grace and poise as she led our class discussions and effortlessly engaged with her classmates. I found myself not only drawn to her beauty but also to her kindness and the way she made everyone feel valued. While it was clear that Althea didn't know me personally, my infatuation with her only deepened with each passing day.</p>

            <p>As time went on, I began to wonder if what I felt for Althea could be love. It was more than just a physical attraction; it was a profound admiration for her character and the way she carried herself. I couldn't help but daydream about what it would be like to get to know her better and maybe even become friends. But the idea of approaching someone as impressive as Althea was intimidating, to say the least. I wondered if she'd ever notice me and if our paths would ever cross in a way that would allow me to express my feelings.</p>
